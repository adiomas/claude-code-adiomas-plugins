name: work-type-classifier
description: >
  This skill should be used when starting any /auto command, when the user
  asks to "classify work type", "detect domain skills", or "create skill
  activation plan". It classifies the type of work requested (FRONTEND,
  BACKEND, FULLSTACK, etc.) and determines which domain-specific skills
  should be invoked during implementation. Analyzes keywords like "UI",
  "component", "API", "backend", "docs", "PDF" in user request and outputs
  a skill activation plan to .claude/auto-context.yaml.

# Work Type Classifier

Analyze user requests to determine work type and map to relevant domain-specific skills for optimal autonomous development quality.

## Classification Process

### Step 1: Analyze User Request Keywords

Scan the user's feature request for keywords indicating work type:

| Keywords | Work Type | Primary Skills to Invoke |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| "UI", "component", "page", "design", "frontend", "React", "Vue", "CSS", "Tailwind", "button", "form", "modal" | FRONTEND | `frontend-design`, `webapp-testing` |
| "API", "endpoint", "backend", "database", "server", "REST", "GraphQL", "authentication", "middleware" | BACKEND | `architecture-patterns`, `api-design-principles` |
| "full stack", "app", "application", "feature" (ambiguous) | FULLSTACK | `frontend-design`, `architecture-patterns` |
| "docs", "documentation", "README", "spec", "proposal", "technical doc" | DOCUMENTATION | `doc-coauthoring` |
| "PDF", "Word", "Excel", "PowerPoint", "spreadsheet", "presentation", "document" | DOCUMENTS | `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx` |
| "integration", "external API", "MCP", "webhook", "third-party" | INTEGRATION | `mcp-builder` |
| "test", "e2e", "Playwright", "testing", "coverage" | TESTING | `webapp-testing`, `test-driven-development` |
| "art", "visual", "poster", "GIF", "animation", "graphic" | CREATIVE | `canvas-design`, `algorithmic-art` |

### Step 2: Output Skill Activation Plan

Create `.claude/auto-context.yaml` with detected information:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by work-type-classifier
# DO NOT EDIT - regenerated on each /auto command

request_analysis:
  original_request: "<user's original request>"
  detected_keywords:
    - keyword1
    - keyword2
  work_type: FRONTEND|BACKEND|FULLSTACK|DOCUMENTATION|DOCUMENTS|INTEGRATION|TESTING|CREATIVE

skills_to_invoke:
  # Always invoked regardless of work type
  discipline:
    - superpowers:brainstorming
    - superpowers:test-driven-development
    - superpowers:systematic-debugging
    - superpowers:verification-before-completion
    - superpowers:requesting-code-review

  # Invoked based on detected work type
  domain_specific:
    - skill-name-1
    - skill-name-2

  # Optional skills that may help
  optional:
    - optional-skill-1

phase_instructions:
  phase_2:
    - "Invoke superpowers:brainstorming"
    - "If FRONTEND: Also invoke frontend-design for design guidance"
  phase_4:
    - "Invoke superpowers:test-driven-development for EVERY task"
    - "If FRONTEND: Apply frontend-design principles during implementation"
  phase_6:
    - "Invoke superpowers:verification-before-completion"
    - "If FRONTEND: Run webapp-testing with Playwright"
```

### Step 3: Skill Mapping by Work Type

#### FRONTEND Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - frontend-design      # "Avoid AI slop, make bold design choices"
  - webapp-testing       # Playwright e2e testing
optional:
  - ux-designer          # Accessibility, user experience
  - artifacts-builder    # Complex React artifacts
```

#### BACKEND Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - architecture-patterns    # Clean Architecture, DDD
  - api-design-principles    # REST/GraphQL best practices
optional:
  - mcp-builder             # If external integrations needed
  - senior-architect        # Complex system design
```

#### FULLSTACK Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - frontend-design
  - architecture-patterns
optional:
  - webapp-testing
  - api-design-principles
```

#### DOCUMENTATION Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - doc-coauthoring         # Technical docs, proposals
optional:
  - internal-comms          # Status reports, newsletters
```

#### DOCUMENTS Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - pdf                     # PDF manipulation
  - docx                    # Word documents
  - xlsx                    # Spreadsheets
  - pptx                    # Presentations
```

#### INTEGRATION Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - mcp-builder             # MCP server creation
optional:
  - api-design-principles   # API design for integrations
```

#### CREATIVE Work Type
```yaml
domain_specific:
  - canvas-design           # Visual art, posters
  - algorithmic-art         # Generative art, p5.js
optional:
  - slack-gif-creator       # Animated GIFs
  - brand-guidelines        # Branding
```

## Integration with Phases

### How Other Phases Use auto-context.yaml

Each subsequent phase reads `.claude/auto-context.yaml` to know which skills to invoke:

**Phase 2 (Requirement Understanding):**
```markdown
1. Read .claude/auto-context.yaml
2. ALWAYS invoke: superpowers:brainstorming
3. IF work_type == "FRONTEND": ALSO invoke frontend-design
4. IF work_type == "BACKEND": ALSO invoke architecture-patterns
```

**Phase 4 (Parallel Execution):**
```markdown
1. Read .claude/auto-context.yaml
2. ALWAYS invoke: superpowers:test-driven-development
3. Apply domain_specific skills during implementation
4. IF test fails: invoke superpowers:systematic-debugging
```

**Phase 6 (Review):**
```markdown
1. Read .claude/auto-context.yaml
2. ALWAYS invoke: superpowers:verification-before-completion
3. IF work_type == "FRONTEND": Run webapp-testing (Playwright)
4. ALWAYS invoke: superpowers:requesting-code-review
```

## Quality Standards

- ALWAYS create `.claude/auto-context.yaml` at start of /auto command
- ALWAYS include discipline skills regardless of work type
- Classify work type based on MAJORITY of keywords found
- If ambiguous, default to FULLSTACK
- Log classification reasoning for transparency
